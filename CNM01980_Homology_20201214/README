Q5K7L9: Putative RBP from C. Neoformans (CNM01980)

DHX57 – Uncharacterized, probable ATP-binding RNA helicase. C3H1 zinc finger associated with mRNA 3’UTR binding. UBA/RWD ubiquitin associated domains.   

DHX29 – Involved in translation initiation in mammals, required for mRNA with structured 5’UTRs. Binds 40S ribosome near mRNA entrance. Non processive helicase 	activity. 

TDRD9 - Acts downstream of piRNA biogenesis in the nucleus, coupled with MIWI2. ATPase activity essential in the process of nuclear accumulation and transcriptional silencing.  

DHX9 (RHA) – Well characterised in many roles, component of siRNA pathway as RISC complex component, N-term dsRBD mutations and co-IP characterise interaction with Ago2 MID domain. 

YTHDC2 – Key role in male and female germline. Binds m6A containing RNAs, binding and promoting degradation. Allowing successful progression of meiotic program.  

DHX36 – Specific unwinding of GR nucleic acid structures, well characterised in DNA and RNA interactions for multiple genes.
